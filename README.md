In this project, I'll be creating a sort of sketch page, where a user can move their mouse through the sketch to create a trail
of a certain color as a sort of stroke of a paint brush.

This project should display some proficiency with CSS and flexbox, when creating the colors and aligning the boxes of the grid
for the sketch pad. It should also display some familiarity with JavaScript, by sensing the user's mouse when it travels across
the screen, along with responding to user input to change the number of squares on the sketchpad
